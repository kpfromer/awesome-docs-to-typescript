# awesome-docs-to-typescript

## Description

A project to learn more about ASTs and to convert [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/)'s [docs](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/) to a TypeScript typing file.

This typing file will then be used with [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) to write awesomewm code in TypeScript that will be transpiled to Lua.

The reason to write this in TypeScript is (1) I am more comfortable with TypeScript, (2) better tooling like prettier, eslint, etc, (3) TYPES = less time digging around in the docs to find that one thing.

## Note:

This is a WIP project.
